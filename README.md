First run "npm i" in the main folder. This installs a Dev-dependency script that is the mechanics of the 
multi-script functionality

"npm run iall" installs dependencies on both server and client side

"npm run start" runs server, as does "npm run server" I created two because I'm trying to break my "npm run start" 
habit.

"npm run client" starts the client side only

"npm run all" starts both front end and back end on one command
