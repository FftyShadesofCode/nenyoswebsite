                <p>We are a non-profit membership organization chartered by New York State and open without restriction to all who are interested in orchids. The organization was formed in 1963 by orchid lovers in the Capital district who were passionate about growing, studying and enjoying orchids.

                Members range for beginner to expert and grow them in a variety of conditions, from windowsill to greenhouse.</p>

                <h1>About Orchids</h1>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, orchids are not difficult to grow once we understand their requirements. The majority are epiphytes, meaning attached to trees or structures, and require humid but fresh air surrounding their roots. Many are terrestrial or lithophytes, growing in rich humus-y, soils or across rocks. Members of this largest of all flowering plant families are found in every environment on earth. In fact, there are many more NATIVE orchid species in Alaska than in Hawaii.

                A common misconception is that orchids must be kept hot with high humidity. Actually, most will thrive in the same comfortable conditions of your home. A greenhouse is not required. Growing them well, however, is a combination of proper light, temperature, moisture and nutrients depending on which type of orchid they are and where in their natural habitat they are found originally. As a rule of thumb, hybrid orchids are less demanding than the species.</p>
